/// WARNING: READ THIS BEFORE DEPLOYING
/// Do not use Uniswap V3 as an oracle unless you understand its security implications.
/// Instead, consider using another provider as a primary price source.
/// Under PoS a validator may be chosen to propose consecutive blocks, allowing risk-free multi-block manipulation.
/// The cardinality of the observation buffer must be grown sufficiently to accommodate for the chosen TWAP window.
/// The observation buffer must contain enough observations to accommodate for the chosen TWAP window.
/// The chosen pool must have enough total liquidity and some full-range liquidity to resist manipulation.
/// The chosen pool must have had sufficient liquidity when past observations were recorded in the buffer.
/// Networks with short block times are highly susceptible to TWAP manipulation due to the reduced attack cost.
