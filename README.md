# Euler Price Oracles

Euler Price Oracles is a library of minimal and immutable oracle adapters. Contracts in this library implement `IPriceOracle`, an opinionated quote-based interface for price oracles. To understand how Price Oracles fit into the [Euler Vault Kit](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-vault-kit), read the [EVK whitepaper.](https://docs.euler.finance/euler-vault-kit-white-paper/#price-oracles)

## `IPriceOracle`

All contracts in this library implement the `IPriceOracle` interface.
```solidity
/// @return outAmount The amount of `quote` that is equivalent to `inAmount` of `base`.
function getQuote(
    uint256 inAmount, 
    address base, 
    address quote
) external view returns (uint256 outAmount);

/// @return bidOutAmount The amount of `quote` you would get for selling `inAmount` of `base`.
/// @return askOutAmount The amount of `quote` you would spend for buying `inAmount` of `base`.
function getQuotes(
    uint256 inAmount, 
    address base, 
    address quote
) external view returns (uint256 bidOutAmount, uint256 askOutAmount);
```

This interface shapes oracle interactions in an important way: it forces the consumer to think in [amounts rather than prices.](https://hackernoon.com/getting-prices-right)

### Quotes

Euler Price Oracles are unique in that they expose a flexible quoting interface instead of reporting a static price.

> Imagine a Chainlink price feed which reports the value `1 EUL/ETH`, the *unit price* of `EUL`. Now consider an `IPriceOracle` adapter for the feed. It will fetch the unit price, multiply it by `inAmount`, and return the quantity `inAmount EUL/ETH`. We call this a *quote* as it functionally resembles a swap on a decentralized exchange.

The quoting interface offers several benefits to consumers:
- **More intuitive queries:** Oracles are commonly used in DeFi to determine the value of assets. `getQuote` does exactly that.
- **More expressive interface:** The unit price is a special case of a quote where `inAmount` is one whole unit of `base`.
- **Safe and flexible integrations:** Under `IPriceOracle` adapters are internally responsible for converting decimals. This allows consumers to decouple themselves from a particular provider as they can remain agnostic to its implementation details.

### Bid/Ask Pricing

Euler Price Oracles additionally expose `getQuotes` which returns two prices: the selling price (bid) and the buying price (ask). 

Bid/ask prices are inherently safer to use in lending markets as they can accurately reflect instantaneous price spreads. While few oracles support bid/ask prices currently, we anticipate their wider adoption in DeFi as on-chain liquidity matures. 

Importantly `getQuotes` allows for custom pricing strategies to be built under the `IPriceOracle` interface:
 - Querying two oracles and returning the lower and higher prices.
 - Reporting two prices from a single source e.g. a TWAP and a [median.](https://github.com/euler-xyz/median-oracle)
 - Applying a synthetic spread or a volatility-dependent confidence interval around a mid-price.

## Oracle Adapters

An adapter is a minimal, fully immutable contract that queries an external price feed. It is the atomic building block of the Euler Price Oracles library.

### Design Principles

The `IPriceOracle` interface is permissive in that it does not prescribe a particular way to implement it. However the adapters in this library adhere to a strict set of rules that we believe are necessary to enable safe, open, and self-governed markets to flourish.

#### Immutable

Adapters are fully immutable without governance or upgradeability.

#### Minimally Responsible

An adapter connects to one pricing system and queries a single price feed in that system.

#### Bidirectional

An adapter works in both directions. If it supports quoting `X/Y` it must also support `Y/X`.

#### Observable

An adapter's parameters and acceptance logic are easily observed on-chain.
